DECODER:
TMC is a Titan Micro Electronics communication protocol for driving LED driver
chips based on bidirectional two-wire serial bus using 2 or 3 signals
(CLK = serial clock, DIO = data input/output, STB = strobe). Those chips driver
7-segment displays with simple keyboards.
This protocole decoder is suitable for the chip TM1636, TMP1637, TMP1638.
Chips TM1636 are compatible with TM1637 chips as for driving 7-segment LEDs.
TM1636 drives 4 LEDs and has no support for keyboards. TM1637 drives 6 LEDs.

NOTE:
The TMC two-wire bus is not IÂ²C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) bus because there
is no slave address and in contrast data bytes are transmitted with least
significant bit first.
